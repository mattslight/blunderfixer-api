# Backlog / Future Ideas

- [ ] Add time pressure classification (moves made in < 3s)
- [ ] Implement "Replay the Mistake" interactive mode
- [ ] Detect and replay major evaluation collapses (e.g. +3 → ≤0)
- [ ] Mistake stats dashboard:
  - Sortable by type (tactical/positional/time)
  - Filter by game phase
- [ ] Endgame trainer:
  - Auto-detect won-but-lost endgames (+2 eval post-queen trade)
  - Let user play out vs engine from that point
- [ ] Opening explorer with stats on win/loss by opening
- [ ] Profile-level trend analysis (e.g. consistent blunder types)
- [ ] Export annotated games (PDF / PGN + summary)
- [ ] Multi-language support (English, Spanish, etc.)
- [ ] Chess.com OAuth integration (optional: auto-import games)
